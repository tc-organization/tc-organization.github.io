			Video games is one of the best ways for me to relax myself physically and emotionally. Sometimes, after I finished all my school work, and I get too much pressure on me, I will open my OMEN3 PRO and start to play some games. The four games, League of Legends, Overwatch, Grand Theft Auto Five and Counter Strike Globle Offensive are my favorite games. As you can see, I'm not kind of person who play offline which means play alone. No matter what kind of enterteinment ways, I will always play on team or multiplayer.

				<h4 id="GTAV">Grand Theft Auto V</h4>


				<p>
					<a class="resoucetex"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_V"target="_blank">Grand Theft Auto V</a> is an action adventure game. It was developed in September 2013 by Rockstar which is a game company. In my opinion, this game is the freest game I have played because you can do everything you want in this game, such as killing people, robbery, racing and missions. It also has plenty of other system that connect to the real world, such as the economic system. By the way, people that are under 18 years old cannot play or watch this game.
